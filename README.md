# CS-3243 Final Project

Final project in my JBU Data Structures and Algorithms Class.

In this project, you will build a phone directory application that compares the performance of different data structures.
The required data structures to be used are listed below. You can use Microsoft’s Collections/BCL code, or other library
(cite whatever code you borrow).
• array (such as List)
• linked list
• hashtable (such as Dictionary)
• self-balancing binary search tree (such as a red-black tree)
• one additional data structure of your choice… try to do something different than your classmates.
Your program (or programs) will have two parts. You may implement them in a single program or as separate programs.
The programs may use a GUI, or they may use a console window, and should be written in C# either way.

**Part 1** will allow you to search the data file to find a particular record by manually typing a search term (into a textbox
or into the console window). 

**Part 2** will numerically measure the performance of the different data structures.
